        "Use preferredProvider to try one provider first, or providerOrder to "
        "override the broker chain for this call when source constraints matter. "
        "Provider names accepted by those arguments are core, semantic_scholar, "
        "arxiv, and either serpapi or serpapi_google_scholar. "
        "Optional filters: year, venue, publicationDateOrYear, "
        "fieldsOfStudy, publicationTypes, openAccessPdf, minCitationCount. "

        "retrieval use search_papers_bulk. "

        "does not fall back to other providers. This is the provider-specific "
