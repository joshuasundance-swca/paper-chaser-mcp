# Scholar Search Golden Paths

This document captures the primary planning assumptions for the MCP surface so
agents can choose the next tool with low context and high reliability.

These same discovery, pagination, lookup, and citation paths are exercised by
the agentic smoke test in `.github/workflows/test-scholar-search.md`.

## Primary Personas

- **Quick discovery user**: wants a strong first page fast to decide whether to
  dig deeper.
- **Researcher doing exhaustive retrieval**: wants many papers across pages to
  build a reading list or dataset.
- **Citation chaser**: starts from one paper and expands outward through cited-by
  and reference relationships.
- **Known-item lookup user**: has a messy title, DOI, arXiv ID, URL, or partial
  clue and wants the right paper quickly.
- **Author-centric user**: wants to understand an author's work, recent output,
  or collaborators.

## Golden Paths

### 1. Quick literature discovery

1. Start with `search_papers`.
2. Read `brokerMetadata.nextStepHint` for the recommended next move.
3. Inspect `brokerMetadata.providerUsed` and `brokerMetadata.attemptedProviders`.
4. Decide whether to broaden, narrow, paginate with `search_papers_bulk`, or
   pivot into citations/authors.

**Example request**: "Find recent papers on large language model alignment"

**Tool sequence**:
```
search_papers(query="large language model alignment", limit=10)
→ read brokerMetadata.nextStepHint
→ if more needed: search_papers_bulk(query="...", limit=100)
→ for interesting paper X: get_paper_citations(paper_id=X.paperId)
```

**Success signals**

- `brokerMetadata.nextStepHint` is readable and tells the agent what to do next.
- The first response clearly explains where the results came from.
- The agent can explain whether to broaden, narrow, paginate, or pivot.

### 2. Exhaustive retrieval

1. Start with `search_papers_bulk` when the request asks for all results, the
   first N results across pages, or a dataset-like collection.
2. Treat `pagination.nextCursor` as opaque and pass it back as `cursor`
   unchanged.
3. Continue until `pagination.hasMore` is false.

**Example request**: "Get me all papers on RLHF published since 2020"

**Tool sequence**:
```
search_papers_bulk(query="reinforcement learning from human feedback", year="2020-", limit=100)
→ while pagination.hasMore:
    search_papers_bulk(query="...", year="2020-", cursor=pagination.nextCursor, limit=100)
```

**Success signals**

- Cursor handling stays explicit and safe.
- The agent does not misuse single-page tools for bulk collection.
- Pagination state is explained in user-facing language.

### 3. Citation chasing

1. Resolve or confirm the starting paper with `search_papers_match` or
   `get_paper_details` if needed.
2. Use `get_paper_citations` for cited-by expansion.
3. Use `get_paper_references` for backward references.
4. Use `get_paper_authors` if the next step is an author or collaborator pivot.

**Example request**: "What papers cite 'Attention Is All You Need'?"

**Tool sequence**:
```
search_papers_match(query="Attention Is All You Need")
→ get_paper_citations(paper_id=result.paperId, limit=100)
→ while pagination.hasMore:
    get_paper_citations(paper_id=result.paperId, cursor=pagination.nextCursor)
```

**Success signals**

- The agent explains the direction clearly: cited by vs references.
- Returned metadata is rich enough to rank or filter the expansion set.
- The workflow naturally chains from a discovered or known paper.

### 4. Known-item lookup

1. Use `search_papers_match` for messy or partial titles.
2. Use `get_paper_details` for DOI, arXiv ID, URL, or canonical IDs.
3. Fall back to `search_papers` only when the user is really asking a topical
   question rather than an item lookup.

**Example requests and tool choices**:
- "Find the paper called something like 'Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models'"
  → `search_papers_match(query="Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models")`
- "Get details for arxiv:1706.03762"
  → `get_paper_details(paper_id="arXiv:1706.03762")`
- "Look up DOI 10.48550/arXiv.2005.14165"
  → `get_paper_details(paper_id="DOI:10.48550/arXiv.2005.14165")`

**Success signals**

- Disambiguation stays minimal.
- DOI, URL, and identifier-based lookups feel low friction.
- Agents do not spend multiple topic-search turns on a known-item request.

### 5. Author-centric research

1. Start with `search_authors`.
2. Use `get_author_info` to confirm identity and profile metadata.
3. Use `get_author_papers` to expand into the author's work.
4. Use `get_paper_authors` when the user starts from a paper instead of a name.

**Example request**: "What has Yoshua Bengio published recently?"

**Tool sequence**:
```
search_authors(query="Yoshua Bengio", limit=5)
→ get_author_info(author_id=top_match.authorId)
→ get_author_papers(author_id=top_match.authorId, publicationDateOrYear="2022-", limit=50)
```

**Success signals**

- Author search feels first-class instead of secondary.
- Agents can pivot cleanly between paper and author workflows.
- Recent work and collaborator exploration are easy next steps.

## Secondary Workflows

- **Quote or snippet validation**: use `search_snippets` only when title or
  keyword search is weak.
- **Citation export**: use `get_paper_citation_formats` after SerpApi discovery
  when a result exposes `paper.scholarResultId` (a first-class field, `None`
  for non-SerpApi results). Pass `result_id=paper.scholarResultId`, not
  `paper.sourceId`.
- **Budget-aware searching**: steer `search_papers` with `preferredProvider` or
  `providerOrder` before falling back to provider-specific tools.

## Future Work

- Consider per-request or per-session provider preferences for budget-aware use.
- Add success-metric tests that assert workflow cues stay visible in tool
  descriptions and onboarding resources.
