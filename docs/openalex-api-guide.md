# OpenAlex API Guide

This guide describes how the repo now uses the OpenAlex API and what still
matters when extending that support safely.

It focuses on the parts that matter most for the explicit OpenAlex MCP surface
in this repo:

- `/works` as the main paper-search and paper-detail surface
- authentication, rate limits, and polite-pool etiquette
- pagination and batching for large result sets
- search and filter semantics that differ from the existing providers here
- provider-specific payload nuances that affect normalization into MCP-friendly
  paper, citation, and author flows

## Current MCP Mapping

The repo now exposes OpenAlex through dedicated tools rather than the default
`search_papers` broker:

- `search_papers_openalex` for one explicit OpenAlex page
- `search_papers_openalex_bulk` for OpenAlex cursor pagination
- `paper_autocomplete_openalex` for lightweight title completion and
  disambiguation
- `search_entities_openalex` for `source`, `institution`, and `topic` search
- `search_papers_openalex_by_entity` for explicit work pivots by OpenAlex
  entity ID
- `get_paper_details_openalex` for OpenAlex W-id / DOI lookup
- `get_paper_citations_openalex` and `get_paper_references_openalex` for
  OpenAlex-native citation chasing
- `search_authors_openalex`, `get_author_info_openalex`, and
  `get_author_papers_openalex` for the two-step OpenAlex author flow

This separation is intentional: OpenAlex remains outside the default broker
because its citation, author, and paging mechanics differ enough from Semantic
Scholar that squeezing it into the brokered continuation story would be
misleading.

Current implementation notes:

- OpenAlex tool year inputs currently accept `YYYY`, `YYYY:YYYY`,
  `YYYY-YYYY`, `YYYY-`, and `-YYYY`
- `OPENALEX_MAILTO` is validated as an email-shaped string before use
- the client uses conservative built-in pacing/retry defaults
  (`min_interval=0.05s`, `max_retries=2`) rather than separate env vars

Current repo boundaries to keep in mind:

- OpenAlex remains outside the default `search_papers` broker and the default
  provider-order configuration
- production deployments should prefer `OPENALEX_API_KEY` plus
  `OPENALEX_MAILTO` when available, while local development can still fall back
  to mailto-only or anonymous access
- OpenAlex is the repo's explicit secondary graph for
  venue/topic/institution disambiguation rather than a hidden broker hop

## Operating Principles

If you remember only a few things, make them these:

1. OpenAlex is open by default, but production integrations should still send a
   contact email for the polite pool.
2. Treat the API as credit-limited, not merely request-limited.
3. Use list endpoints carefully: they cost more than singleton lookups.
4. Prefer `select` plus targeted filters over fetching full work payloads you do
   not need.
5. For large traversals, use cursor paging and treat `meta.next_cursor` as
   opaque.
6. Search by related-entity IDs, not by free-text author or institution names.

## Authentication and Identification

OpenAlex does **not** require an API key for standard use. For most exploratory
or low-volume MCP use, requests can be made anonymously.

In this repo, production usage should still prefer `OPENALEX_API_KEY` when it
is available. The no-key and mailto-only paths remain supported for local
development, smoke tests, and low-volume exploration.

However, two integration details still matter:

- Add `mailto=you@example.com` to requests, or include
  `mailto:you@example.com` in the `User-Agent`, to join the **polite pool**.
- Premium users can send `api_key=...` to unlock higher limits and certain
  premium-only filters such as `from_updated_date`.

Example:

```text
https://api.openalex.org/works?search=transformer&mailto=team@example.com
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=doi:https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1706.03762&api_key=YOUR_KEY
```

The current official docs describe the polite pool mainly as a response-time
and reliability improvement, not as a separate excuse to ignore the published
rate limits. The client in this repo still enforces its own pacing.

## Rate Limits and Credit Costs

OpenAlex currently documents a credit-based model:

| Endpoint type | Example | Credit cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Singleton | `/works/W2741809807` | 1 |
| List | `/works?search=rlhf` | 10 |
| Content | future PDF/content endpoints | 100 |
| Vector | future vector endpoints | 1,000 |
| Text | `/text/topics?...` | 1,000 |

Published limits:

- **100,000 credits/day** for free users
- **100 requests/second** overall

This matters for MCP design because OpenAlex list traffic is relatively
expensive compared with singleton lookups. A provider implementation should:

- avoid doing broad list queries inside tight retry loops
- reuse results instead of immediately refetching adjacent pages
- prefer singleton follow-ups only for items the user actually needs expanded
- expose limits clearly in provider-specific tool descriptions

Every response also includes rate-limit headers such as
`X-RateLimit-Remaining`, and the `/rate-limit` endpoint can be queried when an
API key is available.

## Base Surface Most Relevant to This Repo

OpenAlex is much broader than this server needs, but the explicit provider
integration in this repo mostly cares about the following:

| MCP capability | Best OpenAlex surface | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| quick paper discovery | `GET /works?search=...` | good default topical search |
| paper details | `GET /works/{id}` | supports OpenAlex IDs and DOI-style lookups |
| exact-ish title lookup | `GET /works?filter=title.search:...` | no dedicated best-match endpoint like Semantic Scholar |
| autocomplete | `GET /autocomplete/works?q=...` | returns lightweight title/hint results, not full work objects |
| references | `referenced_works` on a work | follow with batched work-ID lookup on `/works` rather than one request per reference |
| citations | `cited_by_api_url` on a work | OpenAlex exposes an API URL for incoming citations |
| author pivot | `authorships.author.id`, `/authors`, `/works?filter=authorships.author.id:...` | typically a two-step flow |
| venue/source pivot | `primary_location.source.id` | source IDs are more reliable than searching by venue name |

In this repo specifically, OpenAlex fits best as a metadata-rich search and
lookup provider. It is less of a drop-in replacement for the current Semantic
Scholar expansion flow because several semantics are different:

- there is no direct equivalent of Semantic Scholar's `/paper/search/match`
- incoming citations are exposed through `cited_by_api_url` rather than a
  dedicated sibling endpoint contract like this repo already uses
- abstracts are not returned as plain text

## Works Endpoint Behavior

`/works` is the main entity family for paper-like records.

Common shapes:

```text
GET https://api.openalex.org/works
GET https://api.openalex.org/works?search=diffusion models
GET https://api.openalex.org/works/W2741809807
GET https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=doi:https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1706.03762
```

Important response-shape details for normalization:

- list endpoints return `{ "meta": ..., "results": [...] }`
- single-entity endpoints return the work object directly
- the top-level work identifier is a full URI such as
  `https://openalex.org/W2741809807`
- DOI values are URI-formatted as well, e.g. `https://doi.org/...`

That means the client in this repo should normalize IDs deliberately
instead of assuming short provider-native strings like the current Semantic
Scholar or CORE flows.

## Search Semantics

OpenAlex supports two broad search modes for works:

1. `search=...` for general title/abstract/fulltext search
2. fielded search filters such as `filter=title.search:...`

Important search behavior:

- `search` on works covers title, abstract, and some full text
- boolean operators `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` are supported when uppercase
- quotes and parentheses are supported
- stemming and stop-word removal are enabled by default
- `*.search.no_stem` filters disable stemming for title/abstract-style search
- wildcard and fuzzy characters like `*`, `?`, and `~` are not allowed in
  boolean search; they are removed

Examples:

```text
/works?search=(alignment AND "large language model") NOT benchmark
/works?filter=title.search:transformer
/works?filter=title.search.no_stem:surgery
```

For this MCP server, that means OpenAlex search would sit somewhere between:

- broker-style quick topical discovery, and
- a fielded lookup provider for titles, sources, institutions, and topics

But it would not map perfectly onto the current Semantic Scholar-only filters.
The existing `search_papers_openalex` tool already advertises only the
parameters OpenAlex actually honors, and future OpenAlex tool additions should
keep that discipline.

## Filter Semantics That Matter for MCP Integration

OpenAlex filters are powerful, but they have rules that differ from the current
providers in this repo.

### AND, OR, NOT

- filters are combined with logical AND by default:
  `filter=publication_year:2024,is_oa:true`
- OR within a single filter uses `|`
- negation uses `!`
- AND within a single repeated attribute can use `+` or repeated filters

Examples:

```text
filter=type:article|book
filter=country_code:!us
filter=institutions.country_code:fr+gb
filter=cited_by_count:>100,is_oa:true
```

Important nuance: OR works **within one filter key**, not across different
filter attributes. If a future tool exposes high-level filter composition, it
should not pretend that OpenAlex can express arbitrary boolean combinations
across unrelated fields in one request.

### Batch-by-OR instead of N singleton calls

OpenAlex supports up to **100 values** in one OR filter. This is especially
useful for DOI or ID batch lookup:

```text
/works?filter=doi:https://doi.org/10.1/abc|https://doi.org/10.2/def&per-page=100
```

For this MCP provider, this is the right building block for:

- batched known-item DOI resolution
- hydrating `referenced_works` after reading a single work
- reducing credit usage compared with dozens of singleton GETs

## Pagination

OpenAlex supports both page-based and cursor-based pagination.

### Basic paging

- request with `page=N`
- request size is controlled with `per-page=1..200`
- only works for the first 10,000 results

### Cursor paging

- start with `cursor=*`
- read `meta.next_cursor`
- pass it back unchanged as `cursor=<token>`
- continue until `meta.next_cursor` is `null`

Examples:

```text
/works?filter=publication_year:2023&per-page=200&page=2
/works?filter=publication_year:2023&per-page=200&cursor=*
```

Provider-specific nuance:

- the request parameter is spelled `per-page` in the docs
- the response metadata field is spelled `per_page`
- `next_cursor` is provider-issued and should be treated as opaque

In this repo, the server-side OpenAlex cursor contract stays opaque just as it
does for Semantic Scholar-backed pagination rather than leaking raw provider
pagination assumptions into the MCP surface.

Also note the OpenAlex docs explicitly discourage using cursor pagination to
download the full dataset; for corpus-scale ingestion, the snapshot is the
correct path.

## Data-Model Nuances Relevant to Normalization

Several OpenAlex work fields are especially important when mapping into this
repo's normalized paper shape.

### 1. Abstracts are not plain text

OpenAlex exposes `abstract_inverted_index`, not a plain `abstract` string.

The safest default for this repo would be:

- reconstruct plaintext abstracts client-side for detail-style responses
- omit the abstract field for search/list responses when reconstruction is not
  worth the cost
- never return a misleading partial abstract if reconstruction fails

This is one of the biggest differences from Semantic Scholar and CORE.

### 2. Citations and references use different primitives

- outgoing references are given as `referenced_works`
- incoming citations are accessed through `cited_by_api_url`
- related-paper style exploration is available through `related_works`

This makes OpenAlex viable for citation chasing, but the implementation shape is
different from the existing Semantic Scholar citation/reference endpoints.

### 3. Authorship payloads are capped

`authorships` are limited to the first 100 authors. The normalization layer
should not silently imply that the author list is always exhaustive; if a work
reaches that cap, treat the author list as potentially partial in downstream
MCP responses and documentation.

### 4. Venue/location fields have migrated

The docs explicitly deprecate `host_venue` and `alternate_host_venues` in favor
of `primary_location` and `locations`.

So any new provider code should avoid building on deprecated venue fields.

### 5. Source aggregation affects deduplication

OpenAlex aggregates records from multiple upstream sources, including Crossref,
PubMed, repositories, and arXiv. In this repo that matters because OpenAlex
overlaps heavily with existing CORE, arXiv, and Semantic Scholar coverage even
though it is intentionally kept outside the default broker.

Practical implication: dedupe on stable identifiers like DOI and carefully
normalized titles, not just provider-native IDs.

## Two-Step Related-Entity Lookup

One of the most important OpenAlex patterns is: **search entity, then filter
works by ID**.

Examples:

```text
/authors?search=Yoshua Bengio
/works?filter=authorships.author.id:A5001980242

/institutions?search=MIT
/works?filter=authorships.institutions.id:I136199984

/sources?search=Nature
/works?filter=primary_location.source.id:S137773608
```

This is a good fit for explicit multi-step MCP workflows, but a poor fit for a
single over-broad search tool that pretends free-text related-entity search is
precise. Because this repo already has OpenAlex provider-specific tools,
future author, institution, and source pivots should stay honest about that
two-step pattern.

## `select` for Smaller Payloads

OpenAlex supports `select=field1,field2,...`, but only for **root-level**
fields.

Example:

```text
/works?select=id,doi,display_name,publication_year,cited_by_count
```

This is useful for fast list views and broker-style search results. However, it
cannot select nested fields such as `open_access.is_oa`. The provider client
should therefore maintain a few known-good field sets rather than trying to
build arbitrarily deep response masks.

## Where OpenAlex Would Likely Fit in This MCP Server

Given the current repo surface, OpenAlex's cleanest positioning is:

- **search/discovery**: a free, broad metadata provider with rich filters
- **known-item DOI/title recovery**: especially useful when users have DOI,
  OpenAlex ID, or related-entity constraints
- **citation/reference pivots**: feasible, but with OpenAlex-specific mechanics
- **author/institution/source pivots**: strong, provided the tool flow stays
  explicitly two-step

Less likely clean fits:

- a direct replacement for Semantic Scholar's best-match tool
- a drop-in citation expansion backend without translation work
- any contract that assumes plain-text abstracts are always available

## Recommended Integration Defaults

When extending the OpenAlex client in this repo, start with these defaults:

1. Always send a configured contact email when available.
2. Keep a shared limiter even though OpenAlex's published ceiling is much higher
   than Semantic Scholar's.
3. Normalize `https://openalex.org/W...` and DOI URLs carefully before storing
   IDs in MCP payloads.
4. Use `select` for list/search responses and fetch fuller payloads only for
   details.
5. Use cursor pagination for exhaustive retrieval, but keep the MCP cursor
   opaque and server-issued.
6. Prefer batched OR filters for DOI or reference hydration instead of loops of
   singleton requests.
7. Avoid exposing deprecated venue fields or unsupported cross-field boolean
   semantics in future tool additions.

## Bottom Line

OpenAlex is now a first-class explicit provider surface in this repo because it
is open, metadata-rich, and strong at ID-based filtering and entity pivots.

The main integration traps are not authentication but **semantic mismatch**:

- credit-based list costs
- URI-shaped identifiers
- abstract reconstruction
- two-step related-entity workflows
- citation and paging mechanics that differ from Semantic Scholar

The current implementation follows that recommendation: keep OpenAlex explicit,
provider-specific, and honest about where its semantics differ from the default
brokered Semantic-Scholar-shaped flow.
